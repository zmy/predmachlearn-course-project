In this document, we'll try to analysis the data from <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>, and build models to predict human exercise manners.
```{r cache=TRUE, prompt=FALSE}
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("","NA"))
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
```


## Data Cleaning and Exploration
Firstly, we can easily see that there are a lot of missing values (`NA`) in the data. And there are same amounts of missing values occur in a few columns:
```{r}
apply(training, MARGIN=2, FUN=function(col) {
    sum(is.na(col))
})
```
We can check that the missing values appears on exactly same data points (rows) in all these columns:
```{r}
sum(!complete.cases(training))
```
So let's remove all these columns - since there are only `r sum(complete.cases(training))` out of `r sum(!complete.cases(training))` rows having values on these columns.

And after a closer look at the variables, we notice that there are only few non-numeric columns. In order to get rid of the irrelavant `X` and time varialbes, we also delete corresponding columns.
```{r cache=TRUE}
useful <- apply(training, MARGIN=2, FUN=function(col){sum(is.na(col))==0})
useful[c(1,3:5)] <- FALSE
nRow <- nrow(training)
nVar <- sum(useful)
training <- training[, useful]
testing <- testing[, useful]
```
Now there are only `r nVar-1` columns left for prediction. Notice that the last column of `training` is `classe` variable while that of `testing` is `problem_id`, which is the only difference.


## Training and Testing
```{r prompt=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(caret)
set.seed(23)
```

### Linear Model
Let's quickly try a linear regression (use 60% of samples as training data):
```{r}
trainIdx <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
trainData <- training[trainIdx,]
validData <- training[-trainIdx,]
linearFit = lm(as.numeric(classe)~., data=trainData)
```
And then in-sample testing:
```{r}
summary(linearFit)
missing <- sum(round(predict(linearFit, validData)) != as.numeric(validData$classe))
print(paste0("Accuracy: ",missing,"/",nrow(validData),"=",missing/nrow(validData)))
```

### GBM Model
However, we can have a much better method (though runs slower) to build our model: gradient boosting machine (GBM) using the `train` function from caret.
```{r cache=TRUE, prompt=FALSE}
fitControl <- trainControl(## 10-fold CV
                           method = "repeatedcv",
                           number = 10,
                           ## repeated 10 times
                           repeats = 10)
gbmFit = train(classe ~ ., method="gbm", data=trainData, trControl=fitControl, verbose=FALSE)
```
Here the `fitControl` parameter allows to completely define the way the model parameters will be tuned. The model parameters of the GBM (namely `interaction.depth`, `n.trees` and `shrinkage` which are usually contained in `tuneGrid` parameter of `train` function) were compared using a repeated 10-fold cross validation with accuracy being the metric for comparison.

Following is the result model. (It is also interesting to see the variable importance using `summary(gbmFit)`. But for the sake of space we do not show it here.)
```{r}
gbmFit
```
Then in-sample testing:
```{r}
missing <- sum(predict(linearFit, validData) != validData$classe)
print(paste0("Accuracy: ",missing,"/",nrow(validData),"=",missing/nrow(validData)))
```

### Result
Higher accuracy lead to choose GBM rather than linear regression - we can hope that GBM model will have a smaller out-of-sample error. And the following code generates files for submission:
```
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(predict(gbmFit, testing))
```
